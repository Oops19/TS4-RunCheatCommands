# Run Cheat Commands

This mod runs cheat commands when starting TS4. Add them to a simple text file:
* testingcheats true  # Enable cheat commands
* death.toggle false  # Disable death
* ...


## Usage
Add or remove the commands from 'commands.txt'. 
* To disable a line make sure it starts with '#'.
* To enable a line remove the '#' at the beginning.

For 'toggle' commands always a 2nd parameter 'true/false' or 'on/off' should be supplied.

## commands.txt
The config file '/mod_data/run_cheat_commands/commands.txt' contains all commands with parameters which will be executed.

## commands.ini
The '/mod_data/run_cheat_commands/commands.ini' file defines how to execute the commands as TS4 has two flavors.

## Internals
The commands.txt file will be read and executed two times.
* First time when the 'Loading Screen' appears - there not all cheats work.
* Second time after the household is loaded, there all supported cheats should work
* Commands which are not in 'commands.ini' will be executed for both flavors and one will run fine.

## Cheat commands of other mods
Command line cheat commands are fully supported. 
To print the outfit of the current sim add `s4clib.print_outfit` to 'commands.txt'

## Limitations
* Pie menu cheats are not supported.
* Getting and using a sim_id is not supported. Even though `sims.get_sim_id_by_name "first names" "last names"` should work the result can't be accessed.

## Future / Ideas
Make the sim_id available and allow to loop over multiple sim_ids (e.g. complete 'Goth' family)


# Addendum

## Game compatibility
This mod has been tested with `The Sims 4` 1.111.102, S4CL 3.9, TS4Lib 0.3.33.
It is expected to be compatible with many upcoming releases of TS4, S4CL and TS4Lib.

## Installation
* Locate the localized `The Sims 4` folder which contains the `Mods` folder.
* Extract the ZIP file into this `The Sims 4` folder.
* It will create the directories/files `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.ts4script`, `Mods/_o19_/$mod_name.package`, `mod_data/$mod_name/*` and/or `mod_documentation/$mod_name/*`
* `mod_logs/$mod_name.txt` will be created as soon as data is logged.

### Manual Installation
If you don't want to extract the ZIP file into `The Sims 4` folder you might want to read this. 
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_data` are usually required and should be extracted to `The Sims 4/mod_data`.
* The files in `ZIP-File/mod_documentation` are for you to read it. They are not needed to use this mod.
* The `Mods/_o19_/*.ts4script` files can be stored in a random folder within `Mods` or directly in `Mods`. I highly recommend to store it in `_o19_` so you know who created it.
